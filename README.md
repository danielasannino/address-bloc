# address-bloc

This simple Ruby address book app runs on the command line, presenting the user with a set of text-based menu items to:

View entries
Create an entry
Search for an entry
Import entries from a CSV file
There are just two models (address book and entry) and one controller, and the TDD development process uses RSpec.
